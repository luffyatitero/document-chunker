## Technical Overview

### Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with React and TypeScript, the frontend is a single-page application (SPA) that provides a modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and manages state using React hooks. All document and chunk operations (upload, list, detail, delete) are handled through well-structured components and hooks.

- **Backend:**  
  The backend is implemented with FastAPI (Python), exposing endpoints for document upload, chunking, retrieval, and deletion. It uses LangChain for document chunking and SQLAlchemy with SQLite for persistent storage of documents and their chunks.

### Key Features

- **Document Upload & Chunking:**  
  Users can upload documents (e.g., PDFs). The backend processes each document, splitting it into logical chunks using LangChainâ€™s text splitters. Each chunk is stored with metadata (such as chunk index, content length, and optional parameters).

- **Chunk Visualization:**  
  The frontend displays a list of all uploaded documents. Selecting a document opens a detail view with a two-panel layout:
  - **Left Panel:** Selectable list of all chunks for the document.
  - **Right Panel:** Content of the selected chunk, rendered with syntax highlighting for easy reading.

- **Parameter Configuration:**  
  When uploading, users can specify chunking parameters (like chunk size). These are stored and displayed alongside each document.

- **API Integration:**  
  The frontend uses custom React hooks (`useDocuments`, `useDocumentDetail`) to fetch and manage document and chunk data from the backend. All API URLs are configurable via environment variables.

- **State Management:**  
  The application uses local React state for UI interactions (such as chunk selection) and loading/error handling, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Tailwind CSS ensures the UI adapts to different screen sizes, with a clean and accessible layout.

- **Extensibility:**  
  The modular structure allows for easy extension:
  - Add new chunking strategies or file types in the backend.
  - Enhance the UI or add new features in the frontend with minimal refactoring.

### Data Flow

1. **Upload:**  
   User uploads a document via the frontend. The file and parameters are sent to the backend.

2. **Processing:**  
   The backend saves the file, splits it into chunks, and stores all data in SQLite.

3. **Listing:**  
   The frontend fetches and displays all documents using the `/documents` endpoint.

4. **Detail View:**  
   When a document is selected, the frontend fetches its details and chunks from `/documents/{id}` and displays them in a two-panel layout.

5. **Chunk Navigation:**  
   Users can select any chunk from the list to view its content with syntax highlighting.

6. **Download/Delete:**  
   Users can download or delete documents directly from the UI, with changes reflected immediately.

This technical foundation ensures the Document Chunker is robust, user-friendly, and ready for further development or integration into larger systems.
